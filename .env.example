# Base Path Configuration (Optional)
#
# Set this if your site is deployed under a subdirectory.
#
# Examples:
# - If deployed at: https://example.com/docs/ -> set to /docs
# - If deployed at: https://docs.example.com/ -> leave empty (use root)
# - If deployed at: https://example.com/ -> leave empty (use root)
#
# This prevents 404 errors in search results when clicking links.
# The crawler automatically detects this from next.config.ts if not set here.
